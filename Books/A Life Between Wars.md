## 1963 - Sam
- Elias gave in to his wife, Brenda, and announced that [[Sam]] (an obscure relative) would be included in family gatherings
	- [[Gwyneth Roottree]] had been pushing to include Sam for some time
- Lauren's take: why Sam when there are other distant relatives?
	- Grannie ([[Brenda Roottree]]) had sisters and Grandad [[Elias Roottree]] had a brother or two but they aren't included so why Sam?
